Task -Build a CRUD app using the Firebase Realtime database

NodeJS

The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and sync data between your users in realtime. Realtime syncing makes it easy for your users to access their data from any device: web or mobile, and it helps your users collaborate with one another. When your users go offline, the Realtime Database SDKs use local cache on the device to serve and store changes. When the device comes online, the local data is automatically synchronized.

You have to write CRUD operations according to the Firebase realtime database.
